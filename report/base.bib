abstract = {We report the results of an experimental comparison of airplane boarding methods. This test was conducted in a mock Boeing 757 fuselage, located on a Southern California soundstage, with 12 rows of six seats and a single aisle. Five methods were tested using 72 passengers of various ages. We found a significant reduction in the boarding times of optimized methods over traditional methods. These improved methods, if properly implemented, offer the potential for significant savings to airline companies.}
